## Task 7: Complete Interactive Rebase :
**1. After modifying the commits, save and close the editor.**  
**2. Resolve any conflicts if prompted, then continue the rebase:**
```
git rebase --continue
```
+ The command git rebase --continue is used to continue a rebase process after resolving any conflicts during an interactive rebase or a regular rebase.
