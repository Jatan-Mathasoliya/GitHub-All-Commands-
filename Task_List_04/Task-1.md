## **Task 1: Create a Local Git Repository**

**1. Create a new project folder:**  
   ```bash
   mkdir MyProject
   => This command creates a new folder named "MyProject".

   cd MyProject
   => This command is used to navigates into the created folder.
   ```
**2. Initialize it as a Git repository:**  
   ```bash
   git init
   => This command initializes the current directory(Working Folder) as a Git repository.
   ```

**3. Verify the repository status:**  
   ```bash
   git status
   
   ```
   - **Example Output**:  
     ```
     On branch main
     No commits yet
     nothing to commit (create/copy files and use "git add" to track)
     ```
