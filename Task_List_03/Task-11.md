## **Task 11: Delete a Branch**

**1. Delete a local branch:**  

   ```bash
   git branch -d feature-branch
   ```
   - **Explanation**: This deletes the branch only if it has been fully merged.  

**2. Force-delete a branch:**

   ```bash
   git branch -D feature-branch
   ```
   - **Explanation**: Deletes the branch even if it hasnâ€™t been merged.
