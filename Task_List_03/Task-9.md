## **Task 9: Merging Branches**

**1. Switch back to the `main` branch:**

   ```bash
   git checkout main
   ```
   - **explaination:**  
   - We are switching back to the `main` branch because we want to merge the changes from the `feature/new-feature` branch into the `main` branch

**2. Merge the `feature-branch` into `main`:**

   ```bash
   git merge feature-branch
   ```
   - **Explanation**: Combines the changes from `feature-branch` into `main`.

- => For merge files first we need to go into the branch where we want to merge the other branch.



=> **Note:** If there are any conflicts, you will need to resolve them manually before proceeding.
