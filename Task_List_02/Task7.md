## **Task 7: Merging Branches**

**1. Merge `feature-enhanced` into `main`:**  
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   => git checkout is used to switch the branch.

   => And here main is a branch name we want to switch

   git merge feature-enhanced

   => git merge is used to merge the changes from one branch to another
   ```

   **NOTE:-**   
   
   *If we merge to branch first we need to switch the branch to the branch we want to merge into.* 
   
   *Then we run the command git merge <branch_name>*
