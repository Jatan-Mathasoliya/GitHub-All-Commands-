## **Task 6: Branch Management**

**1. Create a branch and switch to it:**  
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature-branch

   => This command is used to create a new branch named 'feature-branch' and switch to it.
   
   => This command do both tasks.
   ```
**2. List branches:**  
   ```bash
   git branch

   => This command is used to list all the branches in the repository.
   ```
**3. Rename a branch:**  
   ```bash
   git branch -m feature-branch feature-enhanced

   => This command is used to rename the branch 'feature-branch' to 'feature-enhanced'.

   => And then after '-m' we specify the name of the branch we want to rename and the new name
   ```
