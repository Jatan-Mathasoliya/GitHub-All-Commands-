## **Task 3: Creating and Committing Files**

1. Create a file:  
   ```bash
   echo "Hello Git" > file1.txt
   => This command is used to create a new file called file1.txt and write the string "Hello Git" into it.
   ```
2. Stage and commit the file:  
   ```bash
   git add file1.txt
   => This command stages the file for the next commit.

   git commit -m "Initial commit: Added file1.txt"
   => This command commits the staged file with a meaningful commit message
   ```
