## **Task 4: Viewing Changes**

**1. Modify the file:**  
   ```bash
echo "Git is awesome!" >> file1.txt
=> What It Does:
echo "Git is awesome!": Outputs the text "Git is awesome!" to the console.

>> file1.txt: Appends the text to the file named file1.txt.

If file1.txt does not exist, it will create the file and then append the text.
   ```
**2. Check file status and differences:**  
   ```bash
   git status
   => This commad Shows the current state of the working directory and staging area.

   git diff
   => This command Shows the line-by-line differences between the working directory and the last committed version of the file.
   ```
